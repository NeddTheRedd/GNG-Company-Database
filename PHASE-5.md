For Phase-5, I felt the most useful application that our program was missing was the ability to order data in a meaningful way. I created a part of the program that is likely to contain the heaviest load of data (Campaigns, Volunteers, Members, and Expenses), and rather than have a query system that targets specific niche queries, it sorts all aforementioned entity sets by any columns specified by the user. This allows the user to easily hone in on any specifc information that is needed quickly and efficiently. Ex. Need expenses incurred between specific dates, or get all your data organized by name, id, area code, etc, use our sorted query method. I found this to be the most efficient way to to query our most referenced tables.
