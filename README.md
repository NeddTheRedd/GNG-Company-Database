# GNG-Company-Database
- Database and Query examples for 'Green-Not-Greed', a fictional non-profit. <br>
- The data, the PostgreSQL database, and the user interface were all created to demonstrate a proficiency in SQL, Python, and an understanding of database infrastructure. <br>

The database can be re-created using the [construct](https://github.com/NeddTheRedd/GNG-Company-Database/blob/main/gng-construct.sql), or [replica](https://github.com/NeddTheRedd/GNG-Company-Database/blob/main/gng_dump.sql), of my database. All data inserts will occur automatically. <br>
The user interface for the database was created in Python. The program can be found [here](https://github.com/NeddTheRedd/GNG-Company-Database/blob/main/gng.py). <br>

Here is the E/R Diagram, a visual representation of the entities and their relationships in our [database](https://github.com/NeddTheRedd/GNG-Company-Database/blob/main/gng-construct.sql):
