# GNG-Company-Database

This project showcases a relational database design for "Green-Not-Greed," a fictional non-profit organization. It demonstrates proficiency in SQL, Python, and database infrastructure concepts. <br>

The database schema manages information about the organization, its members, campaigns, and other aspects. It can be built and deployed using the [construct](https://github.com/NeddTheRedd/GNG-Company-Database/blob/main/gng-construct.sql), or [replica](https://github.com/NeddTheRedd/GNG-Company-Database/blob/main/gng_dump.sql), SQL files. The script populates the database with sample data. <br>

---
The project also includes a Python user interface for interacting with the database, demonstrating additional skills in application development. The program for our UI can be found [here](https://github.com/NeddTheRedd/GNG-Company-Database/blob/main/gng.py). <br>

Here is the E/R Diagram, a visual representation of the entities and their relationships in our [database](https://github.com/NeddTheRedd/GNG-Company-Database/blob/main/gng-construct.sql):
