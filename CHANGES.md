1. We re-inputed the table (campaign) as we had manually inputed the id values for the TA presentation but it was causing problems in the python implemenation. We let the serial method of ID handles the entity when we re uploaded the dummy data. 

2. We added a 'Notes' field into Capaign, Member, and Volunteer. This allowed much easier access for annotating those entity sets on the fly. 

3. Turned all my queries into views for code efficiency, but also to get practice with views.
